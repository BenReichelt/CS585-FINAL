# CS585-FINAL
A repo for our CS585 groups project on Style Transfer.

Our topic is style transfer. An optimization technique taking two images: Content image + Style reference image
And blending them together so the output image looks like the content image, but portrayed in the style of the style reference image. 

To use:
1. Upload ipynb to google COLAB.
2. Run first cell on ipynb to import everything necessary and build helper functions.
3. Next run data set arrays.
4. Next run styleDriver().
5. Next define the set you wish to analyze at the bottom.
